## Ingredients
- crust
    - flour 300g
    - powder sugar 66g
    - salt 1/2 tsp
    - butter 170g melted
    - vanilla optional (recommended)
- filling
    - sugar 600g
    - 3 lemons, zested
    - flour 60g
    - lemon juice 240g
    - 8 eggs
## Steps
- set oven to 350F
- add parchment paper to 9" x 13" baking dish. Have parchment paper come up two sides to allow easily lifting out when done
- in a bowl combine all ingredients for crust. Mix into a rough dough
- put dough into pan, squish and level with something flat
- bake dough for 20 min or light golden
- to make *filling*, in a food processor, add sugar, zest of lemons. Run food processor until sugar gets yellowed and zest is broken down
- put lemon sugar in bowl, add flour then mix, then add lemon juice and eggs. Mix.
- put filling onto crust once it's done baking
- bake around 25 minutes, turning halfway. Middle should jiggle a little when done
- chill thoroughly
- optionally when serving sprinkler powdered sugar (I don't care for it)


## Notes
- make sure fix filling will for no lumps
