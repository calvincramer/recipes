2. add eggs, incorporate
3. add in rest of ingredients, incorporate until smooth and no lumps
4. pour in baked crust
5. wrap bottom of spring-form pan with tinfoil to make water tight

7. fill vessel with 1 inch or so of boiling water
8. put in oven at 325F for 1.5 hours until set but slightly jiggly in center
